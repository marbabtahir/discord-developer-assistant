## 4️ Discord Portal Configuration

Before starting the bot, complete the Discord setup:

1. **Bot** → No privileged intents required (leave all off).
2. **OAuth2 / Installation** → Scopes: `applications.commands`, `bot`. Permissions: **Send Messages**, **Use Application Commands**, **Read Message History**, **Embed Links**.

Full details: **[docs/DISCORD_SETUP.md](docs/DISCORD_SETUP.md)**.

## 5️ Build and Start

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

The bot will connect to Discord, register slash commands, and listen for interactions.

**Optional:** Register commands only (e.g. after changing command definitions):

```bash
npm run register
```

**Development** (with auto-reload):

```bash
npm run dev:watch
```

---

# Required Discord Bot Permissions

The bot needs:

- **Send Messages**
- **Use Application Commands** (slash commands)
